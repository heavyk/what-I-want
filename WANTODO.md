#### primary goals/concerns
- make the body capable of absorbing *all* frequencies (black), and as soon as the body is capable of absorbing, it's capable of emitting those same frequencies -- which means that *all* colours are able to be output, meaning that the body will appear 2d, and have no depth (cause no shadow is cast and no gradient). although the body retains a 3d+ shape to it, it *appears* 2d and flat.
- build a (symbolic/conceptual) system where the angle and other conditons determine the emission spectrum (like how metals are more luminous (like a sunspot) at an angle, and darker looking head on). this will allow for really cool shading effects giving us that really cool anime/cartoon appearance. the conceptual aspect is for blending my emotion into the colour and shading as well -- so if I'm upset I can have stronger shading in specific places vs others, when I'm feeling good, maybe my skin has a rainbow or even changes colour to the enviroment/music (inspired by octopi). I (personally like the idea of having a conceptual system, but I know that a symbolic system is also going to be popular, as well).

#### desired features
- make hair able to be removable mentally/conceptually by making the transmission spectrum that hair would tranmit/receive, no longer part of my perception (I don't care to experience/transmit/receive concepts harmonious with those colours and wavelengths). essentially, those frequencies are allowed to pass right through with minimal distortion like some configurations of crystal, diamond, or glass.
- want to produce a system for determining my resistance levels for certain spectrum -- allowing me to perceive how much energy is dissipated and how much is retransmitted -- with the desire being to to have "over-unity" (amplification) of all conceptual spectrum that are important to me, and (perhaps) a reduction or a transformation of the received concept into another (ie, splattered blood and violence/suicide = it was attracted/desired). the idea being that I don't wanto be dissipating/transforming absorbed energy into an unwanted spectrum (like heat or a similarly uncomfortable concept like embarrassment). (this may be related to hair, as well)
