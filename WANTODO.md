# WANTODO

- make hair able to be removable mentally/conceptually by making the transmission spectrum that hair would tranmit/receive, no longer part of my perception (I don't care to experience/transmit/receive concepts harmonious with those colours and wavelengths). essentially, those frequencies are allowed to pass right through with minimal distortion like some configurations of crystal, diamond, or glass.
- want to produce a system for determining my resistance levels for certain spectrum -- allowing me to perceive how much energy is dissipated and how much is retransmitted -- with the desire being to to have "over-unity" (amplification) of all conceptual spectrum that are important to me, and (perhaps) a reduction or a transformation of the received concept into another (ie, splattered blood and violence/suicide = it was attracted/desired). the idea being that I don't wanto be dissipating/transforming absorbed energy into an unwanted spectrum (like heat or a similarly uncomfortable concept like embarrassment). (this may be related to hair, as well)
