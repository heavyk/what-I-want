### 2023-08-17 19:51 - the icosahedron and dodecahedron dual

I know there willl be other other tetrahedrons, ... and many other dual configurations (lots to be discovererd) will be their sory of frequency, where they essentially are just a different conceptualisation agreement thmat makes them seem -- I guess, kinda more like a woman, but it's because I've just got and extra pair of Xx, where they're duals of each other. I'll just set the standand and stay there, menanwhilst everyone else buildds their own reality. I'm just one of the others. we're justt one of the others.
I prefer icoshahedronr in dodecahedruon dual. they're just adorable reflections of each other. a simly, double mirror,  oh me, jeuluxzxy thzzc others could think think that *everyone* will be better than me,     huh, that's kinda cool.
    just a side thought here: I thougyt that it woould be able to kind of like *retord* my writing, because sometimes I have a wierd cadance.
