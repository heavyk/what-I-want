# open sourcing myself

### 2023-08-22 11:20 - human chromium

one of the goals of this project is to make myself essentially like the google chromium of humans; I've taken a lot of inspiration from software development, and I think genetics can learn a little bit in this regard. a long time ago, when the internet was still young, there was netscape navigator and internet explorer as the browsers -- and shortening a very long story, it turns out that in order to win the browser war, you have to open up the source code, so that anyone can take it. nowadays, almost every browser is based on google's chromium browser, and for good reason: it's got the latest technology (web developers love this), and it's always up-to-date and frequently updated with those new features (each time more and more transparently), and so one part of "winning" the browser war is to actually have a good product that anyone can copy and modify to their own specifications (like microsoft edge), or even turn into something quite useful (like github's electron).
I want to do the same thing with my own genetics: I want to make it fully possible for anyone to take any aspect of my genetics and to be able to reuse it and repurpose it to whatever they want to do with it *with no strings attached*.
  there are a number of software licenses that do just that ([MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net), etc.) and I've always put one of these licenses, opting usually for the [Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/) (simply because I like the name more than anything -- and it has the least number of conditions), but the point of the license is to allow anyone to use/modify/alter and even make money off of my code, *with no strings attached*.
I suppose there are some nuances to the idea, but I plan to make all aspects of my genetics, from the actual sequence itself, all the way to the technology required to make the modifications allowing for essentially *any* startup with even a small amount of funding to begin modifying their own body (and anyone else they get access to).
  sure, I could see how some might think that this idea sounds like bringing chaos to the world, and give large companies a capacity to have a quite a bit of power over our perception -- but I think that reality is already upon us.
    I've mentioned that I believe I'm at the centre of a pretty large conspiracy, where "the network" (or whatever its called) is actively engaged in reducing some people's perception (like me), and also boosting other people's perception as well. I'm not interested in trying to fight them (or anyone else trying to modify my perception), as I've found out that not only is my genetics a reflection of my perception, but that the hardware (that is the DNA), is only the physical reflection of a non-visible (very high frequency concept) which is "me" (who I *really* am), and so while we can manipulate harware all we want, ultimately, the hardware is still the reflection, and not the other way around.
  I feel extremely confident that any and all attempts to disable another's perception in any way, is more like fuzzing for a security vulnerability more than anything -- and any such attempts will automatically correct theirselves with time because all physical genetics is *always* going to be a reflection of its source concept (specifically desire + concept; see the-manual), and so ultimately all of these vulnerabilities in our perecption, will be fixed/improved, and it's actually the open sourcing, which is improving things.
  given a sufficient amount of time, I anticipate the entire system of our genetics and perception arriving to a more and more stable state; it's fine :)
