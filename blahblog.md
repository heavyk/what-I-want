### 2023-09-16 15:36 - I don't really know what I want still

it's very important, and I cannot stress this enough: I still don't know what I want. the entire thing is still in brainstorming phase, and I'd like it to stay that a while. I definitelly not saying that no work should be done on implementing the idea, just that it should be considered more like a prototype, than a final product. it's very possible that I still don't have the idea worked out as well as I had imagined, and I still feel there are considerable improvements That can be made on the idea.
