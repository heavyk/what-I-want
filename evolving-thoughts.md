### 2023-08-22 09:34 - I don't really know what I want

I've spent the last few days thinking a lot about this idea of what I actually want, and I've come to the conclusion that I don't really know what I want. I'll explain my thinking here:
  one of the things that I find most important in my genetics is that it adheres to the simplified perspective arrangement of 1-2-5-7
    see "the-manual" for an explanation of what those numbers mean (to me at least), and because our genetics are a reflection of our perception, I'm referring to the way that I want to think and also perceive reality through these new genetics.
    the way that I've figured it out (so far) is that the y-chromosome is something like a tetrahedron in its frequency shape, and all of the chromosome pairs essentially are self-canceling mechanisms, where the frequencies that *don't* get canceled, are the frequencies that the body needs, and so therefore the rest of the genetics jumps in to build the stuff necessary to make it possible to fully cancel the opposite chromosome's signal entirely.
      (this is essentially how growth and a lot of other important things happen: by noticing somethming is missing and trying to find a replacement component/genetics/machine which can produce the missing frequency).
    as such, each chromosome has a balance to it, and so for XX, each chromosome is designed to cancel the other one out, producing a stable 0 signal, which is why girls (before sex) are so much more docile/calm/whatever than boys are; simply because their body is pretty balanced from the start, and it isn't until strong emotional encounters (experienced in the brain, trauma, sex, etc.) begins to produce a frequency that isn't getting fully canceled (which again desires to be canceled, and so a suitable something is desired to find a way to cancel that frequency).
      I don't really know how to explain this idea cause I haven't figured it out completely, but I believe YY *is* possible, but not anywhere in this physical earth without an X, because the Y is much more like 2nd ray perception, and so for a Y to *actually* be compatible with itself here on earth, both Ys would need to transmit a frequency that is nearly perfectly cancels itself out -- and since *nobody* has the same two sets of desires and a symbolic system to accomplish those desires, it is impossible to have YY in the physical (it is possible however in astral (2) and specrtral (4) though) because the symbolic narratives toward that desire, don't actually need to cancel each other out fully to be able to continue to stay alive.
      the thing I don't fully understand is that 2,4,6 secondry layers are each a mix of the two primary layers: so, 2 is a mix of 1&3, and 4 a mix of 3&5 -- so I don't understand fully how the Y can be both a mix and a tetrahedron, unless of course it's a tetrahedron dual, and one tetrahedron represents the most tetrahedron-like primary layer, and its dual the opposite primary layers.
        that actually kinda makes sense actually, and would explain a lot of things -- most notably how XY pairs work, because the X would then have to constantly conform to something that resonates with those dualing tetrahedrons (huh, interesting...)
  so, what I'm looking for in my 1-2-5-7 setup is for the 1,5&7 to all be x-chromosomes, and I don't want to have a Y, which means that the 2 will come *only* from the brain/mind, just the same as it does for XX presently.
  I haven't mentioned it here, but from my MRI it's possible to see I don't have a pinecone (the giant light sitting on top of the pineal/cetre of the brain which emits light much like the corona of the sun), and I want that part of the genetics removed and/or changed to be somegthing diffrerent (essentially the same as I have now -- but I don't know exactly what, yet) -- but the objective to explain here is that without a pinecone, I don't *see* (or feel/experience) anything in my imagination or spectral, and so I really only experience 2nd ray perception as a non-visual thing (hard to explain what that's like concisely).
    I'm saying that *I* (personally) don't want to experience that form of perception in a tangible (4,6) way at all, and only want to have my *brain* responsible for anything symbolic/logical in my perception, as I find that having symbol and logic (or narrative, like egregores) mixed into genetics, is not something I want to experience. however, I want to make it fully possible for others to still mix my genetics with symbolic (3) X and Y cromosomes to produce fully autonomous beings/slaves. I don't want it, but I won't stop anyone else from producing automatons in that sense.
  it's also important for me that 2nd ray perception is something that is experienced in the body, because you'll notice that I don't have any symbolic layers, and so the traditional logical thinking will be changed significantly in how it operates (I'll write on this in the-manual), as it'll now be based essentially all around feeling
    which is a bit difficult to explain, but imagine mathematical and logical operations can be performed something like listening to music: play one note/number/concept and then alter that note/number/concept with another one, and the result is a symbolic operation such as add/sub/mul/div/and/or/not/etc. -- and so because 2nd ray is all about how one thing relates to another conceptually, these beings will be *very* materialistic (as pure symbol/maths simply won't exist for them). all things are real and exist in a conceptual state, relating to all other things conceptually as well.

so even though I don't really know exactly what I want yet, the picture that is beginning to emerge (over the last few days) is this: I'm fairly certain that I have both XX and also XY. I want to get rid of the Y, and I offer it to anyone who wants it, and I recommend it to many females, as clearly it's a XY pair that works well with an XX. my XY pair, the Y chromosome is essentially going to have the narrative perspective that I have now: it's all attraction (more on that later), and so the X that's paired with it, will be something like PURE DESIRE/EVIL (depending on how you look at it), and so in the process of separating the Y out, I want to make the X a dual of itself: the 1.
  then for the other XX pair, I don't yet know my options, but one idea that I was thinking is trying to see if I could make one of them become very rigid/physical in its perception, making it very cube/carbon-like, and its dual would be the octahedron; the opposite to 1: the 7.
finally, I'd like to add another XX pair (bringing me from 24 up to 25 pairs) which I have no idea at all how to do yet, and this one will be the water/ether pair: icosahedron/dodecahedron. the importance of getting 20 triangles to resonate with 12 pentagons is going to produce a whole new concept thatt I've been calling the "pen-rose". (more on that later)
what all of that will accomplish is that I'll have three perfectly balanced XX pairs, which because they're balanced like that will operate as if I have 3 x-chromosomes (like I have now), but without the Y.

at this stage, it's too difficult for me to say exactly what's going on, and it could turn out that I'm literally living lala-land, and after sequencing my dna, we find out, no I don't have XXXY (or any other strange anomaly), and I'm just another regular dude. what I can say for sure though, is that I simply don't have what I want fully figured out yet (as evidenced above), and so I need to keep "brain storming" a bit further...

as for implementation, I know the basic idea, and it's quite simple: DNA is frequential, and so the first steps are to begin with simply (known) cells, isolating them and bombarding them with a full spectrum (so obviously we'll be using carbon as the emitter/receiver). the principle is simple (the basis of spectroscopy): a perfect emitter is a perfect absorber; or, in radio communications, an antenna tuned to transmit on a certain frequency will also be able to receive on the same frequency; any frequencies that the cell/DNA absorbs, it's also able to emit on that frequency -- and so we can begin to learn its 3d shape (the way that its folded) simply by studying its absorbtion spectrum. then, we can begin to look at the way that signals travel down the DNA (it's like a giant circuit board), and the charge of the oxygen atoms determines (for example to branch left,right,straight) -- and so then we can figure out the logic of the DNA and begin to construct our own nuclear machines.
  one of those machines will be a vibrating antenna, that essentially will become a reflector for us to use inside of the nucleus. from there, we'll be able to modulate different frequencies and see where they bounce to, allowing us to "look inside" and see the inner more dense parts of the cell, the same way that you would be able to "look inside" of the earth and find higher and lower density areas. using that intra-cellular reflector, we'll be able to essentially map the entire body -- and, for obvious reasons, we'll want to make each reflector have a unique frequency to it, so that frequencies targetted at my body will go uniquely to my body only, and not others.
     there are other complications here too, because it would be undesirable that children would have the same frequency as either of their parents, and so a sufficiently wide spectrums of unique ids will need to be put to make it near to impossible for to children to ever randomally get the same id.
I'm pretty confident in saying that *conceptually* I know how to produce the result that I want, however in practicality, it's A LOT OF WORK.
  I don't really know the feasibility of this honestly, as I've been pretty isolated, and it seems that I'm in the middle of a pretty large conspiracy, because it seems that my life/thoughts/sight/senses/etc are being broadcast out to a lot of people, and my attempts to figure out what is happening have lead me to discover that the thing that I want to create (what the entire repository is all about), may already exist -- and may also be what is broadcasting my experience out to other people.
    it may be the classic story of "the turtle and the rabbit" -- where the rabit is given a significant head-start in the race, yet the turtle just plugs along ever so slowly toward the goal.
    I'll eventually get to make what I want to make, and I know that you (or anyone else reading this), can't really make my desire a reality -- but I do know that the first step is to start thinking about what I want, as it's a constantly evolving idea.
