### 2023-10-01 23:39 - theory on history in reverse

I've been listening to a lot of lectures ovew at centre-place (on youtube), and it's becoming more and more overwhelingly clear to me that there seem to be hundreds of cultures that passed through significant upheaval (flood) -- arriving essentially to a "new earth" -- and crazily enough (look at the mayas) they seem to come in with some mind-blowingly complicated language and/or writing system. it appears to me that these languages could have *only* cultivated in a fairly high energetic enivronment (something like a golden age), but that collapsed, and they find theirselves on earth, in the *physical* world where things are tough and no longer is that dream-like reality that they once had.
